        <h2>Fueling Your Performance</h2>
            <p>Nutrients play a crucial role in physical activity and can greatly impact an individual's performance and overall health. 
            Proper nutrition is essential to fuel physical activity, promote muscle recovery and growth, and prevent injury.</p>
           
            <p>Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source for physical activity. 
            The body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose, which is then used as energy by the muscles during exercise. 
            Adequate carbohydrate intake can improve athletic performance, delay fatigue, and prevent muscle breakdown during long-duration exercise. Complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains and fruits, are a good source of sustained energy, while simple carbohydrates, such as sugars, provide a quick burst of energy but can lead to blood sugar fluctuations. Protein is essential for muscle growth and repair.
            During physical activity, muscles experience micro-tears that need to be repaired to promote growth and prevent injury. Adequate protein intake can speed up the muscle recovery process and promote muscle growth. Protein sources such as lean meats, fish, dairy, and plant-based sources like legumes and nuts can provide the necessary amino acids for muscle repair and growth.</p>
            
            <p>Fats are also an important energy source during low-intensity exercise, but it is important to choose healthy fats such as those found in nuts, seeds, avocados, and fatty fish. 
            These fats provide essential fatty acids that cannot be produced by the body and are important for overall health and well-being. In addition to macronutrients, micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals also play an important role in physical activity. Calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone health and can reduce the risk of stress fractures and other bone injuries. 
            Iron is important for oxygen transport in the blood and can prevent fatigue and improve athletic performance.</p>
